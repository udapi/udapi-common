# NAME

Udapi - Application Programming Interface for Universal Dependencies

# DESCRIPTION

Udapi is a collection of three APIs for processing Universal Dependencies data.
The three mutations are developed in Perl, Java, and Python respectively.
The APIs are based on the same object-oriented conceptual model, and are
harmonized as much the differences between these programming languages allow.

See http://udapi.github.io/ for more information on Udapi.
